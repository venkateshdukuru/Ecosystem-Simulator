# Ecosystem-Simulator

The primary objective of this program is to create an interactive, visual simulation of a simple ecosystem. It allows a user to:

Create Life: Define different "species" of creatures, specifying their name, color, diet (herbivore or carnivore), and initial population.

Observe Interactions: Watch these creatures live within a shared environment on the canvas. Herbivores search for and consume plants, while carnivores hunt and consume herbivores.

Simulate Natural Processes: The simulation models basic life-cycle events like energy consumption (cost of living), reproduction (when energy is high), and death (from starvation or old age).

Analyze Population Dynamics: Through a statistics panel, the user can track the population of each species in real-time, observing how populations rise and fall based on the availability of food and the presence of predators.
